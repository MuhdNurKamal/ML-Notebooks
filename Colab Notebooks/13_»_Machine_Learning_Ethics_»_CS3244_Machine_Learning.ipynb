        "_Welcome to the Week 13 Python notebook._ This week is perhaps the most important week in your course as we connect our class to the application of ML to the real world.  Machine learned models affect you directly but also in many indirect ways, more numerous than you may imagine.  It is hard to properly ascribe the proper attention we need  to give to the application of ML, as most learners will underestimate the impact that it has on others – especially populations who we (in)advertently do not consider.  This is why the ethical application of machine learning is at the heart of ML.  Although you have likely already had a course on ethics in technology, it is necessary to reinforce those concepts with the slant enabled by ML. \n",
